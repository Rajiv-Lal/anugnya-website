                                <p>You're not imagining it—this exhaustion is crushing, and almost everyone going through chemo experiences it.</p>
                                
                                <p>Neerad, who went through a bone marrow transplant, describes it simply: "I fell at least 50-60 times in the first three months. Somebody had to wash my body. I couldn't bend my hand." For Sangeeta, walking to the balcony was a victory.</p>

                                <p>Sangeeta found that rebuilding the gut naturally made a real difference. Traditional Indian drinks like kanji (fermented carrot water) and room-temperature buttermilk with roasted cumin helped when nothing else worked.</p>
